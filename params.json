","body":"**# Summary:**\r\nThis was my first attempt to create the front/back-end of an app in order to learn the Rails framework.\r\nThe app works similar to a Craiglist website: with categories of listings, and with each listing created by a user.\r\nOne key feature is that listings can only be edited by its author; this is accomplished by using a special key in the URL. Only the author knows the key and can go to the edit URL.\r\n\r\nGems used: \r\n* 'pg' for PostgreSQL\r\n* 'faker' for Faker gem to generate fake user names, posts, comments. \r\n\r\nAuthors: Uzma Rahman, Phillip Mispagel\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
