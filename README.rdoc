My first Rails app made during Dev Bootcamp !

Initially, the app had been made with Sinatra, a lightweight web framework.
With Rails, there were lots of changes. To name a few:

1. Routes and the controller logic get separated, in Rails, into the routes.rb and the controller files.

2. Views, partials and form helpers.

3. The shortened version of AJAX: handling only the response cycle.
